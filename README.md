# nk-missile-tests: North Korea Missile Test Visualization

An interactive visualization of flight tests of all missiles launched by North Korea from 1984 to 2017.

See a [Live Demo](https://nagix.github.io/nk-missile-tests).

## About Data

The data for this visualization are sourced from [the CNS North Korea Missile Test Database](http://www.nti.org/analysis/articles/cns-north-korea-missile-test-database/), which the first database to record flight tests of all missiles launched by North Korea capable of delivering a payload of at least 500 kilograms (1102.31 pounds) a distance of at least 300 kilometers (186.4 miles). The database captures advancements in North Korea's missile program by documenting all such tests since the first one occurred in April 1984, and will be routinely updated as events warrant.

The CNS North Korea Missile Test Database doesn't include the exact landing locations, so we have added bearing information from other sources such as Japan Ministry of Defense, and landing locations are calculated based on locations of launching facilities and distances travelled.
